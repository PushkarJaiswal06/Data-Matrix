                The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck argues that individuals
                should seek to find meaning through what they find to be
                important and only engage in values that they can control.
                Values (such as popularity) that are not under a person's
                control are, according to the book, 'bad values'. Furthermore,
                individuals should strive to replace these uncontrollable values
                with things they have the capability to change, such as
                punctuality, honesty, or kindness.

                  A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of high fantasy novels by
                  the American author George R. R. Martin. He began writing the
                  first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and published it in
                  1996. Martin, who originally envisioned the series as a
                  trilogy, has released five out of seven planned volumes. A
                  Song of Ice and Fire depicts a violent world dominated by
                  political realism. What little supernatural power exists is
                  confined to the margins of the known world.
